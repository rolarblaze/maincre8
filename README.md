## Contribution Guidelines

### Branch Structure

We have three main branches in our repository:

- **main**: This is the production branch. No direct pushes are allowed.
- **staging**: This branch is used for hosting on a subdomain before going to production. No direct pushes are allowed.
- **dev**: This is the development branch where all new features and bug fixes are merged first.

### Creating a New Branch

When working on any features or fixes, create a new branch from `dev` using the following naming conventions:

- **Feature implementation**: `feat/name-of-feature`
- **Bug fixes**: `bug/name-of-bug`
- **UI design implementation**: `design/name-of-design`

Example:
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feat/awesome-new-feature
```

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `dev`.
2. Once your work is complete, push your branch to the remote repository.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into `dev`.
4. Add the team lead (or designated reviewer) for approval.
5. After the PR is approved and merged, delete the branch to keep the repository clean.

### Commit Messages

All commit messages must be descriptive and follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Be concise but descriptive ("Fix crash on load" not "Fix bug").
- Use a prefix for your commits:
  - **feat**: for new features
  - **fix**: for bug fixes
  - **design**: for design changes

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
```
